# MongoDB Provider for Entity Framework Core

This solution is inspired by [Blueshift.EntityFrameworkCore.MongoDB](https://github.com/BlueshiftSoftware/EntityFrameworkCore) and aimed to bring the support of MongoDB support for [EFCore 3.1](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/tree/release/3.1).

Much code will be based on the previous one.
